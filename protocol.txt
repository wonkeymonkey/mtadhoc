Right now only discovery-request has been redone,
others pending

Currently a Packet includes: source, destination, type, data. Right now the design includes the following packet types, not all have been reimplemented:


===Multicast===
discovery-request    :Request all unlisted nodes reply with a discovery-response, known nodes will be listed in the data block

===Unicast===
discovery-response   :

known-request        :Request a node reply with all of its known nodes, this allows nodes to be aware of stations outside of their transmit radius
known-response       :Known stations are included in the data block

relay-request        :Request a specific node transmit a packet contained in the data block


chain-size-request   :Really simple "hashchain" implementation
chain-size-response
chain-data-pull
chain-data-push
